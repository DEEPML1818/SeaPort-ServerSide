### If you have questions or need any help, Message me here: [@cyber_lawd](https://t.me/cyber_lawd) 

[OpenSea-Seaport](https://github.com/cyberlawd/OpenSea-SeaPort) is a brand new, open-source, web 3.0 marketplace protocol that enables buying and selling of NFTs safely and efficiently . Launched first on Ethereum, Seaport has helped create a better, more feature-rich experience for our community, while lowering the cost to use web 3.0 marketplaces, like OpenSea. The implementation also includes a [ClientSide](https://github.com/cyberlawd/OpenSea-SeaPort).

This framework is written using Python and uses the [Django Rest Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework). To simplify writable nested serializers package [drf-writable-nested](https://github.com/beda-software/drf-writable-nested) was used also.
